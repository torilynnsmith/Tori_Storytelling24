Gallery
The Louvre art gallery in Paris, France. It's dark and closed for the day. There is a chair here facing a painting on the wall and a statue on a pedestal. An old, antique trunk is here as well.

A door to what looks like the bathroom is to the east, while a door that says "Security Office" is to the west.

>w
You haven't looked around enough yet.

>east
Oh, you don't have your bathroom book yet.

>end
That's not a verb I recognise.
